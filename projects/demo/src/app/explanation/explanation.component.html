<h1>Angular Material Search Select</h1>

<p>
  This library provides a "Search Select" component for use with
  Angular Material. Behind the scenes, the mat-autocomplete component
  is used, but the resulting experience is not an auto complete; that
  is, it does not assist the user and optionally skipping some typing.
</p>

<p>
  Rather, this component is for select controls where the user will
  search from a (potentially long) list to make a selection. Moreover,
  this list may be far longer than can fit in the user
  interface/browser, and might arrive asynchronously from server-side
  searches.
</p>

<p>
  For a fuller explanation, please see the project README, and its
  source code.
